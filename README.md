I am trying to write a Python program that will facilitate the playing of **Let's Play Two!**, a game published by Hot Stove Games that strives to recreate the tabletop simulation played by J. Henry Waugh in Robert Coover's classic novel, _The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop._
